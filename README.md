# Micro-reddit

Micro-reddit creates *events* associated with *users* through rails Active records. This project is based on  [theodinproject.com](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/micro-reddit). 

Micro-reddit has no views and is designed to be tested from the `rails console`.
